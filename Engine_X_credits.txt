Platforms: Windows, Mac OS X

Special thanks to MH, Spike and R00k.  

MH and Spike always help me with obscure and complex questions, R00k and I have long exchanged ideas back and forth.  
Engine X incorporates some code written by MH (Direct3D 8.1 wrapper, Windows MP3 support).  
Engine X is largely based on ProQuake and JoeQuake, with some features from Qrack, FTEQW, DirectQ, Quakespasm,
FitzQuake, FuhQuake.  The Mac version leverages work by Fruitz of Dojo GLQuake and Woods.

Report improvement ideas, bugs, etc. to the QuakeOne.com forums.  Feature list is there also.

Windows Note: The MSVC6 project will compile.  The Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 project and the CodeBlocks projects
need some extra source files added to the project to compile.  I don't have MSVC2008 right now.  And was too lazy
to update the CodeBlocks project.
